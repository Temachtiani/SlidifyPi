## Introduction

</br>
<p>Bootstrap is an statistical technique used to estimate parameters under a minimum of asumptions.</p>

<p>Bootstrap works resamplig $m$ times a fixed sample of size $n$ with replace and estimating the parameter of interest each time.</p>

<p>From $m$ estimates of soma parameter the empiricaldistribution of the parameters is built, which can be used to construct confidence intervals or testing statistical hypothesis.</p>


<p>From ageometric approach, $\pi$ is defined as the ratio between a circumference an it perimeter.</p>


<p>As it is well known, $\pi$ is an irational number that can be calculated with defined presicion using numeric sequences.</p>


<p>An alternative way to define the number $\pi$ is as expectation of random variable estimated through bootstrap techinque.</p>

## Methodology

1. In order to build the empirical distribution of random variable with expectation being the irrational number $\pi$, a sample of size 1000 and bootstrap 3000 repetitions are given.

2. Two random samples of size 1000 are taken from uniform distribution in $(-1, 1)$.

3. If squared sum of each pair of samples is less than one, number one is assigned, otherwise a 0 is assigned. Then proportion is calculated.

4. Every point selected belongs to a square with area equals 4, then 4 times proportion is an estimation of $\pi$.

5. This procedure is repeated 3000 times to find the empirical distribution, summary, expectation and confidence interval are calculated.

6. Two plots are build: scatterplot of las uniform variables selected and histogram of empirical distribution of pi with mean an confidence interval of 95% drawn in vertical red lines and mean confidence through t.test function in green lines.

## Notation and algorithm

</br>
</br>
Mathematically the algoritm is as follows:

1. Define an empty numerical vector $v$ of dimension $m$;
3. generate sampes of size $n$ from $x_1\sim\mathcal{U}(-1,1)$ and $x_2\sim\mathcal{U}(-1,1)$, where $\mathcal{U}(a,b)$ is a uniform distribution in the interval $(a,b)$;
3. generate a vector $w$ of 1's an 0's where $w_i = 1$ if $x_{1}^{2} + x_{1}^{2} < 1$, otherwise $w_i = 0$;
4. Proportion of 1's multiplied by 4 in vector $w$ estimates $\pi$;
5. repeat the process $m$ times populating $v$ with estimates in each iteration;
6. vector $v$ is a sample of a random variable with expectation $\pi$.

## Bootstrap

Red lines in histogram are the bounds of confidence interval for a vector $v$, and green dotted lines corresponde to the confidence interval of mean of samples in vector $v$.

```{r chk01, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, fig.align = 'center'}
vec <- numeric(3000);
for(i in 1:3000){
   x1 <- runif(1000, -1, 1);
   x2 <- runif(1000, -1, 1);        
   vec[i] <- 4*mean(x1^2 + x2^2 < 1);
   }

myCol <- colors()[20:23];

opar <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(2,2,1,1));
plot(x1, x2, pch = 16, col = ifelse(x1^2 + x2^2 < 1, "green4", "tomato"));
curve(sqrt(1-x^2), add = TRUE);
curve(-sqrt(1-x^2), add = TRUE);
hist(vec, col = myCol, main = "Sample distribution", xlab = "Estimated Pi", ylab = "Frecuencies");
abline(v = quantile(vec, p = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975)), col = "red3", lwd = 3, lty = c(1, 2, 1));
abline(v = t.test(vec)$conf.int, col = "green4", lwd = 2);
par(opar);
```

## Estimation and confidence intervals

**Estimated mean of vector of $\pi$'s**
```{r echo=FALSE}
mean(vec);
```

**Summary for $\pi$ empirical distribution**
```{r echo=FALSE}
print(summary(vec));
```

**Confidence intervel through t.test function for $\mu$ of vector of $\pi$'s**
```{r echo=FALSE}
print(t.test(vec)$conf.int);
```
